	ConsCompiler:
		interface similar to DevCompiler

	localization:
		Kernel.cmdLine:
			decode (encoding = current locale encoding)
		HostConsole:
			encode on printf, encoding = current locale encoding
			decode on Read, encoding = current locale encoding
		filenames:
			HostFiles:
				store encoded (ARRAY OF SHORTCHAR), encoding = currect locale encoding
				display decoded (ARRAY OF CHAR)
				NOTE: Kernel.cmdLine decoded (see ^)
		txt Converter: encoding should be the same as in Windows HostTextConv?

	handle SIGTERM in server version (when Kernel.Start used)

	Comm

	printing (to PostScript)

	GUI:
